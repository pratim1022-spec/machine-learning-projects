🩺 Diabetes Prediction using SVM:-
This project uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to predict whether a person is diabetic based on medical diagnostic data.
It demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow — from data preprocessing to model evaluation — using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

📘 Project Overview:-
Implements SVM classifier for binary classification

Uses the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset

Covers data cleaning, feature scaling, model training, and accuracy evaluation

Visualizes results for better interpretability

🧠 Technologies Used:-
Python

scikit-learn

pandas

numpy

matplotlib / seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

📂 Files:-
Diabetes Prediction - Using SVM.ipynb — main notebook
